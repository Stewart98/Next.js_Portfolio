        <div className="text-2xl font-semibold text-fuchsia-700">Hello, there!</div>
        <div>My name is Mamogapi from Free State, and I finished my studies in 2020 at the Tshwane University of Technology with a Diploma in Computer System Engineering.
             From 2021 till October of this year, I was doing my internship at Maluti-a-Phofung Municipality as a Technician/Support.
             Then I realised I was in the wrong career field as I sat down and thought thoroughly about my passions and love.
             I then decided to go out and follow my passion, of being a software developer.
        </div>
        <div>I want to be a developer at SovTech because SovTech is an award-winning, end-to-end custom software development company that designs, builds, deploys, and maintains mobile and web applications.
             With all this, it will be a great opportunity to be part of an award-winning company, and with all that they offer designing to deploying and maintaining, it will be a real challenge but a learning curve beyond all.
             What I am excited about above all is that this Programme is high-intensity that will help me to undergo rapid upskilling to become a Junior professional.
